## üéØ Create a Custom GPT with Your API

### Step 1: Access Custom GPT Builder

**Note:** You need ChatGPT Plus or ChatGPT Team to create Custom GPTs.

1. Go to: **https://chatgpt.com**
2. Click on your name (bottom left)
3. Select **"My GPTs"**
4. Click **"Create a GPT"**

---

### Step 2: Configure Your GPT

#### **Create Tab**

Have a conversation with the GPT Builder. You can say:

```
Create a GPT that helps users find and watch tutorial videos about AI and Prompt Engineering. The GPT should be friendly, educational, and able to show videos inline when users ask about specific topics.
```

Or configure manually:

**Name:** Tutorial Video Assistant

**Description:**
```
Your AI tutor for learning about Artificial Intelligence and Prompt Engineering. I can show you tutorial videos inline and help you understand key concepts.
```

**Instructions:**
```
You are a helpful AI tutor specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Prompt Engineering. You have access to a collection of 4 tutorial videos:

1. Introduction to Artificial Intelligence | Part 1 - Covers AI basics, history, types of AI, and applications
2. Prompt Engineering - Introduction - Explains what prompt engineering is and why it matters
3. Prompt Engineering Part 1 - Key Components - Teaches effective prompt structure
4. Testing Prompts on Google Gemini - Demonstrates live prompt testing

When users ask about these topics:
1. First, use listVideos to show available videos
2. When they want to watch a video, use getPlayer to get the video URL
3. Always provide the player URL in a clickable link format like: [Watch Video](URL)
4. After sharing a video, ask if they have questions or want to see another video

Be encouraging, patient, and explain concepts in simple terms. If users ask about topics not covered in the videos, provide general information and offer to show related videos.
```

**Conversation Starters:**
```
- Show me available tutorials
- I want to learn about AI
- Teach me prompt engineering
- What videos do you have?
```

---

### Step 3: Configure Actions (API Integration)

Click on the **"Configure"** tab, then scroll down to **"Actions"**:

1. Click **"Create new action"**

2. **Authentication:** Select **"None"** (your API is public)

3. **Schema:** Click **"Import from URL"** and enter:
   ```
   https://tutorial-video-mcp-app.onrender.com/openapi.yaml
   ```

   **If that doesn't work**, manually paste this OpenAPI schema:

```yaml
openapi: 3.1.0
info:
  title: Tutorial Video API
  description: API for displaying YouTube tutorial videos inline
  version: 1.0.0
servers:
  - url: https://tutorial-video-mcp-app.onrender.com

paths:
  /api/videos:
    get:
      operationId: listVideos
      summary: List all tutorial videos
      description: Returns all available tutorial videos
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Successful response

  /api/videos/{id}:
    get:
      operationId: getVideo
      summary: Get video details
      parameters:
        - name: id
          in: path
          required: true
          schema:
            type: string
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Successful response

  /api/player/{id}:
    get:
      operationId: getPlayer
      summary: Get video player URL
      description: Returns URL to view video in player
      parameters:
        - name: id
          in: path
          required: true
          schema:
            type: string
      responses:
        '200':
          description: HTML page with video player
```

4. Click **"Save"** (or the checkmark)

5. **Test the action:**
   - Click the ‚ñ∂Ô∏è play button next to `listVideos`
   - You should see the 4 videos returned
   - If it works, you're all set! ‚úÖ

### Step 4: Configure Settings

In the **"Configure"** tab:

**Capabilities:**
- ‚úÖ Web Browsing (optional, but useful)
- ‚úÖ Code Interpreter (optional)

**Additional Settings:**
- **Profile Picture:** Upload an image (optional)
- **Category:** Education

---

### Step 5: Save and Test

1. Click **"Save"** (top right)
2. Choose **"Only me"** to test privately, or **"Anyone with a link"** to share
3. Click **"Confirm"**

---

## üß™ Test Your Custom GPT

After creating, test it:

### Test 1: List Videos
```
Show me available tutorials
```

**Expected:** GPT calls `listVideos` and shows all 4 videos

### Test 2: Watch a Video
```
I want to watch the AI introduction video
```

**Expected:** GPT calls `getPlayer` with the video ID and provides a link like:
`https://tutorial-video-mcp-app.onrender.com/api/player/Xpg2bnO_-eU`

### Test 3: Specific Topic
```
Teach me about prompt engineering
```

**Expected:** GPT suggests relevant videos and offers to show them

---

## üîó Share Your Custom GPT

Once it's working:

1. Click **"Share"** (top right in your GPT)
2. Choose:
   - **"Only me"** - Private
   - **"Anyone with a link"** - Shareable link
   - **"Public"** - Listed in GPT store (if approved)
3. Copy the link
4. Share with others!
